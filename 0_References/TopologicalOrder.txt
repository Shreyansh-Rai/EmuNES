This is just how I maintain my sanity feel free to peak!
Also full disclosure, I am learning, for the love of it, how to emulate...So I will be relying heavily on OLC, reddit, rockwell's data sheet for help.
- make bus and R6502 headers and source.
- make regs and status reg codes and pc stkptr etc.
- Look at reference figure out opcodes and look up addressing.
- Make stubs for now to tackle addressing and ops in 6502.h 
- indirect vs direct addressing
- Need to start with the clock and implementing the instructions and addressing modes.
